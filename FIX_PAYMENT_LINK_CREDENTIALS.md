# Fix: Payment Link Initialization Missing Credentials

## 🐛 Issue

**Error:** "Payment Setup Error: header 'admin' is missing"

**Root Cause:** The payment link initialization endpoint (`app/api/v1/payment-links/[id]/route.ts`) was not including admin credentials when calling the backend API.

## 🔍 Why This Happened

When we implemented the backend proxy pattern, we updated the payment page API calls but missed the initial payment link access endpoint. This endpoint is called when a user first visits a payment link (e.g., `/payment/123`).

## ✅ Solution

Added server-side credentials to the payment link initialization endpoint.

### File Changed:
`app/api/v1/payment-links/[id]/route.ts`

### What Was Added:

```typescript
// Get server-side credentials (no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
const admin = process.env.TORONET_ADMIN;
const adminpwd = process.env.TORONET_ADMIN_PWD;

if (!admin || !adminpwd) {
  console.error('Missing Toronet credentials in environment variables');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { 
      success: false, 
      message: 'Server configuration error: Missing credentials'
    },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}

// Add credentials to request headers
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'admin': admin,
    'adminpwd': adminpwd,
  },
});
```

## 🔒 Security Note

This is still secure because:
- This is a Next.js API route (runs on server, not browser)
- Credentials are accessed without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- They never reach the browser
- Only the server-side code can access them

## 📊 Complete API Routes Status

### ✅ All API Routes Now Secured:

1. **`/api/v1/payment-links/[id]`** - Payment link initialization
   - ✅ Uses server-side credentials
   - ✅ No exposure to browser

2. **`/api/proxy/toronet`** - Backend API proxy
   - ✅ Uses server-side credentials
   - ✅ Proxies all payment operations

3. **`/api/waitlist`** - Visa card waitlist
   - ✅ No Toronet credentials needed (email only)

## 🎯 Payment Flow

### Complete Flow with Credentials:

```
1. User visits payment link
   ↓
2. Frontend calls: /api/v1/payment-links/[id]
   ↓
3. Next.js API route adds credentials (server-side)
   ↓
4. Calls backend: GET /api/v1/payment-links/[id]
   ↓
5. Backend returns payment data
   ↓
6. Frontend displays payment page
   ↓
7. User submits payment info
   ↓
8. Frontend calls: /api/proxy/toronet
   ↓
9. Proxy adds credentials (server-side)
   ↓
10. Calls backend: POST /api/v1/transactions/[id]/verify
    ↓
11. Backend processes payment
    ↓
12. Success!
```

**Key Point:** Credentials are added at steps 3 and 9 (server-side only)

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status:
✅ **Build Successful** - No errors

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] Visit a payment link (e.g., `/payment/123`)
- [ ] Verify payment page loads without "admin missing" error
- [ ] Complete NGN payment flow
- [ ] Complete USD payment flow
- [ ] Complete card payment flow
- [ ] Verify all steps work end-to-end

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix

### 1. Check Server Logs
When you visit a payment link, you should see:
```
Fetching payment link from: http://localhost:4000/api/v1/payment-links/123
Payment link fetched successfully: {...}
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
Should NOT see:
- ❌ "Payment Setup Error: header 'admin' is missing"

Should see:
- ✅ Payment data loaded successfully
- ✅ Payment page renders correctly

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Request to `/api/v1/payment-links/[id]` should succeed (200 OK)
- Should NOT see credentials in request headers (they're added server-side)

## 📝 Summary

### Before:
```typescript
// Missing credentials
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

### After:
```typescript
// Credentials added server-side
const admin = process.env.TORONET_ADMIN;
const adminpwd = process.env.TORONET_ADMIN_PWD;

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'admin': admin,
    'adminpwd': adminpwd,
  },
});
```
